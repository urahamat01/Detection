# Walkin-Process:

Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone.

1) First we have to  Create Training Model using [Teachable Machines](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) where we upload images of 2 diff categories one for mask and other for non mask or any other category that user like to and this teachable machine will train model and once its train the model and we can export that out and used in flutter project.
2) Integrate the  same packages need for  tensorflowlite  with flutter
3) Export the models into Flutter Project 
4)  Build User Interface with Flutter
5) Pick an image from Gallery/Camera
6) Display the output from trainned models  into Flutter UI that classify the considered person has wear mask or not in selected image.
